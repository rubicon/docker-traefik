## A Note on Traefik 1 vs Traefik 2?

<strong>Update (April 19, 2020):</strong> I have switched from Traefik v1 to Traefik v2, which is now my default. Therefore, the setup for Traefik v1 will only receive minor updates (if any). If you are new, follow instructions for Traefik v2.

### Traefik 2 (CURRENT - GENERIC LINUX)

- docker-compose-t2.yml
- docker-compose-t2-vpn.yml
- docker-compose-t2-obsolete.yml (Apps that I do not use anymore)
- docker-compose-t2-web.yml (Docker stack on Virtual Private Server that Runs Wordpress and Other Websites)

### Traefik 2 (CURRENT - SYNOLOGY)

- docker-compose-t2-synology.yml (Apps that I run on Synology NAS using Docker Compose)
- Almost any app from the Traefik v2 docker-compose files listed above can be copy-pasted to the Synology Docker-Compose. I run a few on Synology and the rest on my Intel NUC Linux home server.

### Traefik 1 (NOT ACTIVELY MAINTAINED)

- docker-compose-t1.yml
- docker-compose-t1-vpn.yml

# Usage

--------- ANYTHING THAT HAS "example" IN THE NAME WILL HAVE TO RENAMED APPROPRIATELY ---------

## Installation

First, install Docker and Docker Compose, as described in our <a href="https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/docker-home-media-server-2018-basic/">Docker Media Server guide</a>.

1. Clone the repo.
2. Configure Traefik Docker-Compose snippet and CLI arguments.

- Edit domain name.
- DNS Challenge (for LetsEncrypt verification) is enabled by default for cloudflare. Use the [Traefik Reverse Proxy guide](https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/traefik-reverse-proxy-tutorial-for-docker/) for help with this.
- For other providers other than cloudflare, [check here](https://docs.traefik.io/v2.0/https/acme/#providers).

3. (Optional) Enable or use HTTP Basic Authentication by renaming `shared\.htpasswd.example` to `shared\.htpasswd` in the folder and adding username and hashed password to it.
4. Configure environmental variables (`.env` file)

- Rename the included `.env.example` to `.env`.
- Edit variables in `.env` file.
- All variables (ie. `${XXX}`) in docker-compose.yml come from `.env` file stored in the same place as docker-compose.yml.
- Ensure good permissions for the `.env` file (recommended: 640).

5. Edit `docker-compose-t2.yml` to include only the services you want or add additional services to it. Be sure to read the comments for each app and create any required files. You can copy snippets between any of the various docker-compose files in the repo.
6. Start and stop your docker stack as described in our [Docker Media Server guide](https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/docker-home-media-server-2018-basic/).
7. (Optional) Put non-docker apps behind Traefik proxy by creating traefik rules based on the examples provided.

## Starting and Stopping

I use bash_aliases to simplify starting and stopping containers/stack. Included in the repo is an example of bash_aliases I use (replace USER with your Linux username). Here are some example alias commands:

- <strong>dc1up</strong> or <strong>dc2up</strong> - Create network and start Docker Traefik 1 or 2 stack
- <strong>dc1down</strong> or <strong>dc2down</strong> - Stop Docker Traefik 1 or 2 stack
- <strong>dcup1</strong> or <strong>dcup2</strong> - Start Docker Traefik 1 or 2 stack
- <strong>dcup1v</strong> or <strong>dcup2v</strong> - Start Docker Trafik 1 or 2 VPN stack
- <strong>dcdown1</strong> or <strong>dcdown2</strong> - Stop Docker Traefik 1 or 2 stack
- <strong>dcdown1v</strong> or <strong>dcdown2v</strong> - Stop Docker Traefik 1 or 2 VPN stack
- <strong>dcrec1</strong> or <strong>dcrec2</strong> - Start or recreate a specific service
- <strong>dcstop1</strong> or <strong>dcstop2</strong> - Stop a specific service
- <strong>dcrestart1</strong> or <strong>dcrestart2</strong> - Restart a specific service
- <strong>dclogs1</strong> or <strong>dclogs1v</strong> or <strong>dclogs2</strong> or <strong>dclogs2v</strong> - See real-time logs for the corresponding stack or service
- <strong>dcpull1</strong> or <strong>dcpull1v</strong> or <strong>dcpull2</strong> or <strong>dcpull2v</strong> - Pull new images for the corresponding stack or service
